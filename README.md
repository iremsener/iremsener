<hr>
My name is Ä°rem Åžener. I am a passionate student and practitioner in the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and quantum programming. I share my work on these subjects on my Kaggle and GitHub accounts. I am dedicated to continuously expanding and deepening my knowledge and skills in these areas with great enthusiasm. My interest in quantum programming has led me to engage in projects using Qiskit, supported by IBM, in order to enhance
my abilities and contribute to this new and exciting field. I am working on projects to comprehend the potential of quantum computers and to implement quantum algorithms. My goal is to maximize my knowledge and experience in the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and quantum programming, and to take a pioneering role in these areas. My commitment to continuous learning and self-improvement
will guide me towards achieving this goal.
